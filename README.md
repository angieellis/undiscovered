#### The Development Process

###### Angie - MongoDB, Node.js, Express
###### Spenser - Backbone, HTML, CSS
###### Kei - APIs, HTML, CSS

During the last week of our time at Dev Bootcamp, the three of us completed this final project. 
While other teams decided to reinforce what they learned and create a polished product, our team wanted to continue learning 
and pushing our limits to see what we could accomplish. We learned all these new technologies on our own within a matter of days.
We built a MongoDB database to learn about nonrelational databases. We built the app on Node and Express to explore using Javascript
as a backend. We integrated multiple facets of the Google API, including OAuth, YouTube, and Google Maps. For the front end,
we integrated Backbone and other Javascript technologies.

We struggled with some of the technologies and the learning process involved, but we were able to make our app functional and presentable.
